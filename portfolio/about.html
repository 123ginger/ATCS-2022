            Hello. My name is Bradford Tudor <br><br><br><br>
            I am a lacrosse player in my junior year at Menlo school <br><br><br><br>
            I am pursuing the oppurtunity to play college lacrosse and am using this website as a presentation of who I am and what I want to become. <br><br><br><br>
            I started playing lacrosse when I was in 3rd grade and immediately fell in love with the game. I have played for various club and national teams every since and have built some of the best relationships of my life through the game.<br><br><br><br>
            Even if your new to the game, I would highly recommend you keep with the sport as it can bring someone immense joy, lifelong friends, and amazing collegiate academic oppurtunities.
